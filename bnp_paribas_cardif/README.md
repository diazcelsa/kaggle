As a global specialist in personal insurance, BNP Paribas Cardif serves 90 million clients in 36 countries across Europe, Asia and Latin America.

In a world shaped by the emergence of new uses and lifestyles, everything is going faster and faster. When facing unexpected events, customers expect their insurer to support them as soon as possible. However, claims management may require different levels of check before a claim can be approved and a payment can be made. With the new practices and behaviors generated by the digital economy, this process needs adaptation thanks to data science to meet the new needs and expectations of customers.
In this challenge, BNP Paribas Cardif is providing an anonymized database with two categories of claims:

    1. claims for which approval could be accelerated leading to faster payments
    2. claims for which additional information is required before approval

Kagglers are challenged to predict the category of a claim based on features available early in the process, helping BNP Paribas Cardif accelerate its claims process and therefore provide a better service to its customers.

You are provided with an anonymized dataset containing both categorical and numeric variables available when the claims were received by BNP Paribas Cardif. All string type variables are categorical. There are no ordinal variables.

The "target" column in the train set is the variable to predict. It is equal to 1 for claims suitable for an accelerated approval.

The task is to predict a probability ("PredictedProb") for each claim in the test set.

File descriptions:

train.csv - the training set including the target
test.csv - the test set without the target
sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format
